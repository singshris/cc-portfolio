      <h1>
        It's festival time!
      </h1>

      <p>
        India is currently celebrating <i>Navratri'</i>, an auspicious nine-day Hindu festival dedicated to the deities
        <i>Ram</i> and <i>Sita</i>, marking the victory of good over evil and setting the stage for the "festival of lights"
        a.k.a Diwali. A common sight outside most doorsteps during this time, are <i> rangolis </i>.
        
        <img src = "https://cdn.glitch.me/d4bc6f13-b09b-4f55-89bf-4831c101d69e%2Fpattern.jpeg?v=1634050608702" alt="the image is
                a collage of four rangolis, which are colorful patterns comprising concentric circles filled with multiple powdered colors
                                                                                                                    and patterns drawn in at regular intervals.
                                                                                                                    "/>

    Rangolis are united only in occasion. By design, they vary in tremendous ways tied together by colors and shapes. 
 Geometric rangoli designs are one of the more popularly practised styles on account of their symmetry and simplicity,
  which especially appeals to novice rangoli-makers--the rudimentary skill-level needed for the task mirroring my own
        in p5.js. Consequently, I put together a moodboard to shortlist styles I liked and more importantly, could
        recreate in some capacity.

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <li>
        1. Instead of digitzing one sketch, elements were picked from each and were accompanied by suitable imagery from the
        moodboard during the coding process. These included the dotted outer circle, overlapping central figure, lines, and dots.</li>
           
      <li> 2. The <b><a href="https://youtu.be/NBc5zr5kzJw">central rotating figure</a></b> takes advantage of the angleMode discrepancy when it's set to radians. The resulting
    illusion is created by a single square rotating at a high frame rate around the translated origin.</li>
      
        
 <li> 3. The 'For' loop set the number of circles and quads required outside the central figure while the conditional 'If-Else' 
   statements highlight the shape sets by switching their hues.</li>
    
   
          <br>

      <p>
      <li>1. Randomzing fill colors for the outer dotted circle and the larger dots in rotation via MouseX and MouseY is a nod to 
        the real-life process of rangoli-drawing where the outline is established first and colors are filled in at random. The animating
      colors offer a small-scale look at how digital sketches can be used to test out color combinations before translating the same
        into analog applications. </li>  
        
      <li>2. Rangoli patterns were traditionally meant to serve as aesthetic markers of celebration. They were of course,
        limited by their static nature--a trait that no longer applies when transferred into the virtual drawing scape. 
        Adding motion to my rangoli pattern livens it up further, in addition to lending me a handy tool to sample and choose from
        shifting formations and palettes. It will never replace the real deal but it does immortalize its essence. </li>
