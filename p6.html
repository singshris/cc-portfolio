        Personal habit tracked
      </h1>

      <p>
       My sweet tooth will be the end of me. 
        
        This assignment offered the opportunity to record my well-known craving for literally anything
        with a hint of cocoa or sugar. As soon as the assignment was being discussed on CC Lecture,
        I knew I had to officially put myself on blast for my unhealthy eating habits. I started tracking
        my dessert intake the Tuesday of October 5, all the way through October 11 (a particularly sugary-high note 
        to end on given my friend's Canadian thanksgiving festivities). 
    </p>

        Instructions for reading data portrait
      </h1>

      <p>
        <li>
        1. Hovering over each day will reveal the desserts consumed for that day</li>
           
      <li> 2. The shade of green alludes to the amount of guilt I felt for eating the sweets I did on that day. 
        The darker the shade, the heavier the guilt.</li>
      
        
 <li> 3. Key: 1 emoji = 1 unit
        <p>
          <li>üç∞ - cheesecake slice</li>
          <li> üç¶ - ice-cream (one unit = half a pint approx.) </li>
           <li>üç• - laddoo (a special indian preparation where round morsels are made out of hand millet, jaggery,
             sugar, clarified butter, and of course, sugar), sent by my mother from India  </li>
          <li>üç™ - cookies/biscuits</li>
          <li>‚òïÔ∏è- coffee, actually cold coffees and frappuccinos but this was the closest emoji</li>
          <li>üç¨ - Maltesers</li>
          <li>üçµ - ginger tea </li>
          <li>ü•§ - Coca-Cola </li>
          <li>üç° - Twix ice-cream bar</li>
          <li>üéÇ - chocolate cake slice</li>
          <li>üçØüßÄ - honey & cheese appetizer</li>
          <li>üçπ - sangria </li>
          <li>ü•ß - apple pie </li>
          
          
    Assumptions: brand names have been withheld for the most part unless the brand helps
          form a better picture. E.g. "Coca-Cola" is more specific and comprehensible than "sugar-filled aerated drink".

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <li>
        1. This data portrait was envisioned as a conscious effort to kickstart my healthier eating habits; balancing which
      has been a consistent point of contention my whole life. In a lot of ways, food is a generic interest but in other ways,
      my relationship to it is very personal and unique enough to represent me. </li>
           
      <li> 2. I created a sheet arranging all the data I noted down over the week:<b><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_4EtWSdLpo78QLRQgncOFSvloPq6c4OLIoG_iwTZKq4/edit?usp=sharing">Numbered List</a></b> 
  </li>
      
        
 <li> 3. Key programming concepts employed: conditional statements (IF/ELSE & For), logical operators, functions, and my personal favourites MouseX and MouseY.</li>

      <p>
      <li>1. What did you learn about yourself through the process of self-tracking?
        I learned that I had a problem. I also learned that having to note down what I was eating actually helped
        curb my impulse buys and bites. So in reality, the consumption could have been slightly more. 
</li>  
        
      <li>2. What was gained / lost through the process of data visualization?.  
        At the end of the one week mark, I immediately decided to take a whole day to reset my taste buds. 
        It was an outcome born especially out of this activity. 
        While the date conveys varying degrees of guilt, it could have included more quanitifiable data 
        such as the calories consumed. Perhaps, avoiding it was intentional. </li>
