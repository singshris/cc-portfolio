        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
      The assignment and its questions prompts around being captured through a machine got me thinking about 
      surveillance and its many real-life manifestations. The final concept deals with the phenomenon of real 
     life surveillance with a hint of self-awareness. I adopted a motif from a signage we often come across when 
        walking past private buildings and establishments to act as a stand-in symbol of "being watched".

       <p> The presence of the smiley face imagery serves as a reminder that all computers are linked via their purpose 
        to extract information from us whether it's a CCTV camera or the webcam on our own personal desktop. </p>
      </p>

        Process
      </h1>

      <p>
         I'd sketched out three ideas during the initial brainstorming:
      
        <li>1. "Smile for the Camera"</li>
        <li>2. "Glitch" out the face. </li>
        <li>3. Guess the emotion through facial recognition. </li>
    </p>

      <br> <br> <br> <br>
    <p>
      
   The playful yet ominous irony of the first concept was what caught my attention the most and I began working on
  its form.  
      Closely following <a href = "https://codeburst.io/instagram-filters-with-javascript-p5-js-83f28c9f7fda">this tutorial</a> 
      listed in the assignment page's resources, I was able to construct a start up sketch. 
      <iframe allow="camera"
          width="600px"
          height="400px"
              src="https://editor.p5js.org/shristinos/full/KeWnvgI1j"></iframe></p>
      <p>
        
    
      The pixels were replaced with the eerie smile face motif from signages. An optional threshold filter was added in 
      in case anyone was curious about what parts of the feed the emojis were mapped on.

        Iteration
      </h1>
 <li> 1. I wanted to add a little bit of cheer to an otherwise sobre canvas. To this end, a few new images were added
    in the roster that one can switch between if pressing the space bar. This taught me a lot about making face filters. 
    Now that the mechanism has been set up, I can create countless filters! </li>

      Reflection
      </h1>

      <li>
        1. What have you learned throughout the process of designing an unconventional camera?
    <p>
      The mere possibilities accessed through pixel manipulation are astounding. This feature comes
      just in time for my Major Studio project that tackles notions of identity. I can imagine using 
      unconventional cameras to dictate various avatars of our physical selves and connecting them
      to our internalized makeup. 
        </p></li>
      
        
 <li> 2. How is the process of “seeing” shaped by the choices you make in code?
    <p>
       Even after a year-and-a-half long tryst with video calling, seeing my face is fairly jarring still. I remember
      reading about how people's insecurities with their face shot up during the pandemic because of how Zoom and other
      apps were revealing the asymmetry most of our faces naturally have. To be able to then use an experimental camera
      to "see myself" but not really was a nice break from that reality even if it reminds us of another aspect of reality--
      that our faces have surrendered to the all-too-familiar feeling of being captured and recreated as digital impressions.
      Code dictates the many ways in which this happens because the many variations in our digital impressions are shaped by 
      the variations offered in how the tools are coded. From Instagram's face filters that give us glossy, airbrushed skins, 
      to front-camera video calls that expose our rawest, unfiltered selves, our existence in the interwebs is always bringing
      up new ways of seeing ourselves more than others.
