        This project incorporated the sketches made by my partners Lila Feldman & Zhenyu Yang.

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        1. I built a composite body that borrowed the clean and simple strokes from Lila's moody man, the color-changing 
        properties of Zhenyu's friendly alien, and the playfulness of my candy cane strawberry creature.    </p>
        <p>
           
  2. The corpse's final form interprets certain traits from individual sketches slightly differently in order to 
        homogenize its physical attributes. For instance, since Zhenyu and I chose to stick to uniform straight edges, I 
      straightened out the curves in Lila's sketch to fit the style. Originally, thought out as a bright red-faced candy-esque
      manifestation, my non-human being adjusted to the dynamic color scheme so the head and torso were in unison.   </p>
        
 <p> 3. The legs were maintained in greyscale to honor the outline-structure of its original sketch </p>

      <p>
      <li>1. Incorporating user-defined functions significantly helped structure my code (it still has a long way to go 
        in terms of brevity and eliminating redundancies). </li>  
        
      <li>2. Solely based on the curves in Lila's sketch, I wish I'd learned the Bezier function but using straight lines
        worked better for the overall esthetic so I leave it be. A different iteration could perhaps employ Bezier curves
        just for practise.</li>  
        
      <li>3. The greatest challenge that I overcame to some extent was experimenting with the For loop. Instead of marking 
        each shape's co-ordinates I used the for loop to execute the geometrical pattern of the torso portion, however, 
        success with the logic ended up taking nearly as much time as plotting the co-ordinates manually. </li>

      <p>
        <li>The project mostly utilized lessons from Xin Xin and Katherine Moriwaki's tutorials.</li>
        <li>I learned how to upload images from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO6M5hj0V-o">this tutorial</a> by Dan Shiffman.</li>
        <li>While the code was built from scratch by me, the original sketch collaborators I was 
          assigned were Lila Feldman & Zhenyu Yang. </a></li>
