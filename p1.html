        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        My partner <b>Rama Deshpande</b> described her lost object as so:
        <br>
        I lost a soft toy that I had won in a claw machine on my first ever solo trip to Japan. 
        It was a small mouse-like creature that was white in color. It had small round brown eyes 
        and a round brown nose. Its ears were semi-circular and pink. It was also wearing a shirt 
        with a white collar and white and pink stripes across it. There were two tiny hands and feet. 
        It had  a small chain to attach a key-ring to it or hang it from somewhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        I already had a strong foundation to work off of. Rama was very concise and clear with her
        description, giving me several parameters--enough to create but not overburden. My initial 
        interpretations tackled the object from two views: cross-section and top. The top-view from 
        the outset seemed a better composition that displayed all of Rama's mentioned elements with ease.
        Halfway through my first-ever JavaScript coding however, the decision did feel hasty because 
        the object looked nothing like how I'd envisioned. I'm glad I stuck with it though, because 
        toward the end, it shaped up much better that I thought it would.

        Reflection

      <p>
        A key realization was that of the importance of organization. It may be an assumption taken for granted but as we lay down
        one line of code after another, it gets that much harder to keep track of the end-product <i>especially</i> when it involves "layers".
        My color palette was where I was able to insert my own history; that of a designer who favors the soft and pastel hues. All in all, 
        I am pleased with my first attempt at illustrating through coding, and I only hope to get better from this point on.

        The project borrowed its colour palette from <a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</a> by Fabrizio Bianchi and it remixes <a href="https://glitch.com/~code-portfolio-template">this Glitch template</a> by Xin Xin, Katherine Moriwaki, and Aarati Akkapeddi.
