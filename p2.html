         A face, shaped like a quadrilateral, becomes the base for otherwise dynamic 
        facial features with the eyes, nose, and mouth getting larger and smaller at random
        and changing color with time.

      <p>
        Presenting an oversimplified & over-the-top face. Here's a playful yet somewhat ominous
        creation in a most minimal, flat form so it's creator could focus on getting her code concepts
        right.

        1. I began with the most basic forms I could think of, knowing full well my experimentations in the p5.js 
        editor would take on a life of their own. 
        <img src = "https://cdn.glitch.com/d4bc6f13-b09b-4f55-89bf-4831c101d69e%2FUntitled_Artwork%202.jpg?v=1631701730259" alt = "the image displays 
                                                                                                                                   a yellow smiley face with a grid in a background"/>
        <br>
        <img src = "https://cdn.glitch.com/d4bc6f13-b09b-4f55-89bf-4831c101d69e%2FUntitled_Artwork.jpg?v=1631701591302"/>
        <br> </p>

    2. I wasn't aiming for anatomical accuracy. Clearly. In a recent class we'd discussed Jean-Michel Basquiat,
        which perhaps incepted the artist's overlapping, overexaggerated facial features in my subconscious. 
    </p></br>
        <p>3. The loop left behind multiple shapes and instead of trying to hide the colorful remnants (as I did in a previous iteration), 
        they were positioned to loosely resemble ears instead. Fitting right in with the them of the artwork that loosely resembles a face.

          allow="camera"

        </p><br>
<p> 4. The mouse click interaction is intentionally minimal as there is plenty going on with the center-piece and 
        another layer of movement or bold visuals would be way too overpowering.

        Two weeks into my first coding experience ever and I spend more hours working on code that didn't make it into 
        the final iteration than the code that did. I am fairly happy with my learning curve on this project thought I
        hope to come back to it and successfully add the variations I wanted to.
