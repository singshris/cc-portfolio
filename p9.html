        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
      I used buttons to strike up a series of 3 scenes that lead the viewer to experience filters in addition to 
      the ones introduced in experimental camera. However, instead of simply bombarding the user with the feed as soon as
      the sketch loads, I now include a series of instructions about what's happening and what the sketch will be demanding
        from the user i.e. consent to start their webcam. The intention of the sketch has been updated from being a self-referential
        warning about present-day surveillance into becoming a repository of fun "filters" that are mapped to the
        viewers face. 

       
        <br>
      
          
    
      <h1>
        Process
      </h1>
<p> I sketched out a simple flowchart to map out how someone can be guided through each scene. </p>
      <img src = "https://cdn.glitch.me/d4bc6f13-b09b-4f55-89bf-4831c101d69e%2Fimage.jpg?v=1638618130890"/>
       <li>1. The switch statement was employed to load 3 scenes: a) To welcome the viewer into the sketch, b) to
          inform them that their consent is needed to proceed, c) to give them the option to leave at any point.</li>
          <li> 2. You also get the option to save whatever camera filter you like. The saved images, at this stage, include 
          everything on the canvas but I'm working to find a way to save only the face without the DOM elements or text instructions.</li>
     <li>3. The goal is to keep creating new filters built from tinier elements. As you can see, a fourth image featuring the wave
          from The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Hokusai. </li>

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        <li>The sketch attempts to address the F.R.I.E.S model in the following ways:
      <Li>a. Freely-given: The camera does not start until a user allows them permission to do so using the "Yes" or "No buttons".</Li>
      <li> b. Reversible: The "Leave" button is designed to get someone of the scene that actively utilizes the camera. At this point, a challenge
      is to actually stop the webcam everyone someone leaves instead of just switching scenes.</li>
     <li> c. Informed: The copy included in this iteration of experimental camera tries to keep the user as informed as possible about what
       to expect of their experience.</li>
   <li>   d. Enthusiastic: No additional inputs are demanded of the user if they want to access the face filters. </li>
    <li>  e. Specific: Because the functionality to stop createCapture once the user exits the corresponding scene 
    involves out-of-syllabus functions like tracks and callbacks, it still isn't perfect in being specific. The user exits the scene but
    the camera continues to show live feed--the solutions to which are presently being investigated.</li>

      <p>
        <li>Special shoutout to fellow DT student Hasan Khalid for helping me figure out how the createCapture can be
        turned on only when a button is pressed. </li>
        <li>The project mostly utilized lessons from Xin Xin and Katherine Moriwaki's tutorials.</li>  
        <li>The base code was learned from <a href = "https://codeburst.io/instagram-filters-with-javascript-p5-js-83f28c9f7fda"><b>Instagram Filters with p5.js, Kelly Lougheed </b></a></li>
        <li>The video and pixels tutorial added addtional understanding of the pixel array <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1G6WBvrOBE&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aKKsDHZdDvN6oCJ2hRY_Ig&index=5">
