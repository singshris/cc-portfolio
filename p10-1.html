        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
     An ode to my time as journalist, the random news generator pulls up news about and from countries without filtering it through a particular portal regardless of its nature, left, right or center. 
    For most of us, media is a formest connection to the rest of the world, and consequentlyt, has this unyielding ability to warp out belief systems about people, places, and things. 
   Evidently, this has had drastic effects through history. Catering biased information to selective groups has already been proven to be a tool of mass destruction. 
        I used this opportunity to create a simple interface that brings the user the 9 most recent news headlines from a range of news sources. While the lack of categorizing 
        it a particular beat makes it seem random, it has quite the opposite effect. Perspectives are pieced together onto one canvas, regardless of their source and the reader
        immediately knows where it's coming from. This take on 'News at a glance' is my way of trying to chip away at the echo chambers we're subconsciously building for ourselves on
        account of a manicured digital presence. 
        The constraint of the tool is set by the user when they enter the country they want to read news about.

        Process
      </h1>
<p> I accessed the <a href = "https://apilist.fun/api/unofficial-google-news-api"/>google news api</a>
      
       <li>1. I'd always intended to work with news APIs for this assignment, given the theme of Amy Suo Wu's text.</li>
          <li> 2. Trying to tackle something as new and complex as Query and APIs during finals while also making it relate to the equally new and complex concept of sousveillance was 
            the most challenging part of the process. Multiple news APIs refused to load. Eventually, News API worked best. However, allowing only a 100 requests per day, the source will perhaps 
      have to be replaced or I would have to get a premium subscription.</li>
     <li>3. The JSON dataset created (zoom in): 
      <img src ="https://cdn.glitch.me/d4bc6f13-b09b-4f55-89bf-4831c101d69e/2.png?v=1639797111719"/></li>
          <li>4. The parsed data looked something like this:
             <img src ="https://cdn.glitch.me/d4bc6f13-b09b-4f55-89bf-4831c101d69e/1.png?v=1639797122494"/></li>

    <li>5. Of the available information, I chose to display the main headline, date and time of release, and news source. Even thought the tool is meant
    to automatically pull up the ten latest news headlines, letting the viewer know exactly when still felt important enough to include. </li>
          </p>

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        <li>The sketch attempts to tackle the assignment's sousveillance prompt in the following ways:
      <Li>a. People anywhere in the world, can access news about anywhere else in the world, which means that they are not limited by what news sources are bringing to them.</Li>
      <li> b. While I do acknowledge the irony of using big tech-built APIs to solve problems created by big tech itself, the fact that the the user is removed from its immediate influence
        in using an locally created tool brings us step closer to at least diversify the ways in which we're being delivered important world news.</li>
     <li> c. When building the code for this, I only played the part of a "curator", not manipulating the data in any way but just choosing to represent it in the best way I could 
        as permitted by my skillset. The interface is thus kept simple and non-distracting with all the power given to the text. </li>
    </p>
  <p>
    Basic sampling of the tool (9 headlines are loaded about or from the country that is entered into the input box)
