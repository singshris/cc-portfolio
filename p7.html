        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        Try to get me to balance out my life by dodging bad habits and carrying out good habits.
       Games that are quick to recall often carry a win or lose status. One could say they're BOOLEAN. 
      In my autobiographical game, you will find an 'array' of activities I either struggle to keep up with or guilty pleasures 
      I rarely manage to escape. 
        Your goal as the player is to carry the 8-bit representation of me a.k.a the main character
        through till the very end. 
    </p>

    I knew a few things my game had to be, to be a truly autobiographical one:
    <li>a. It should be text-based or at least involve a fair bit of copy to as an ode to the "writer" me.</li>
    <li>b. Exemplify events big and small that constantly occupy my mind and time.</li>
    <li>c. Evoke a sense of oneness despite the personal narrative of the game--a result of my people-pleasing tendencies
    making me want to leave everything on a relatable note.</li>

   <p>
     <br>
  <li> a. Beginning: The player is presented with the game's premise--"help the main character balance their life".</li>
 <li>b. Middle: Two rounds of game play take place. The first is about avoiding toxic practices or unhelathy coping mechanisms while the
    second is about establishing productive conventions in the form of 'medals'.</li> 
  <li>c. End: The player is told that the game has no clear cut winners or losers and merely symbolizes the everyday struggles
    of living, as witnessed through my lived experiences. </li> </p>

  2. Greyboxing</h2>

  <p>
     Code bugs induced by imported assets aside, I had a fairly successful grey boxing that concretized most
    of the game's functionality. As suggested in class, I tried to implement concepts from the very first to the very recent.
    Consequently, the major drivers of this code are class, mouse & key inputs, objects, switch statements, functions, arrays and array manipulation, cloops and conditionals, logical and dot operators. 
    Supporting drivers include map(), second(), 2D primitives, and Boolean; apart from the other obvious ones.

  3. Designing the game </h2>
  <img src ="https://cdn.glitch.me/d4bc6f13-b09b-4f55-89bf-4831c101d69e%2Fdesigntalk.jpg?v=1636531518726"/>
        <p>
          <li>Vector images were either downloaded from royalty-free resources or designed by me in Adobe Illustrator, and converted to 
          pixel art. </li>
          <li>The main character symbolizes a combination of my personal favorites from the peach and teal color palette to 
          my preferred choice of clothing, a sundress. The character is poised like a ballerina as a nod to my dancing past and present.</li>
  <li>The 8-bit composition was maintained wherever possible to allude to its own simple, nostalgic connection. For the same reason, it made 
    sense as the go-to template for someone's first foray into the realm of game design.</li></p>
       <h2>
         
 4. Adding Sound  </h2> 
      <p>
        
 <li> To round out the autobiographical theme of the assignment, the sound effects and 
   looping background music were created with my ukulele with a little help from Adobe Audition.</li>
 <li> 1. I went with a few of my favorite chord progressions and strumming patterns inspired by songs that are
   important to me (Dmaj7-Amaj7-E from 'Summertime in Paris' by JADEN and C-G-Am-F from 'The Show' by Lenka).</li>
       <li>2. For the sound effects, I added what I perceive as ukulele equivalents of collision, collection, 
  and level up sounds, thus factoring in an additional personal dimension. For "happy" tones like when you pass
        a level or collect a medal, a crisp note or harmonious melody was added while ominous suggestions were accompanied by chords
        in the (what I've always thought was eerie) minor scale.
</p>

          5. Playtesting </h2>
  <img src ="https://cdn.glitch.me/d4bc6f13-b09b-4f55-89bf-4831c101d69e%2Fplaytest.png?v=1636533785049">
  <p>
    
 <li>My flatmate and friends tested out the game in its grayboxing and first draft stages, which lent some useful insights for iteration 
   and evaluation. See a glimpse of my flatmate's testing out the GAME OF LIFE <b><a href="https://youtu.be/6J8tDqFSqJo">here</a></b>. </li> 
      <li><b>Feedback collected:</b>
        1. Make the arrow key more prominent in the first Round because the player couldn't figure out
  that they could move in all 4 directions.</li>
  <li>2. A list of statements needed to be added in to bring back the spliced medals otherwise Round 2 would show nothing when
  the player chose to play the game again.</li>
  <li>3. People confused pressing the enter key on the keyboard with clicking on the enter button on screen.</li>
    <li>4. The word "cute" was most utilized in the description of the game.</li>

        Reflections
      </h1>

      <li>
      
        1. Easily one of the most challenging and rewarding outcomes since I joined DT. I was also able to pick up several
  functions like noise() and the ones related to adding sound. There's a lot about the logic of array manipulation that 
  I'm still struggling with but hope to master now that I've recognized it as a problem area.</li>
           
  <li> 2. I would like to continue developing this game not only to add newer levels but to also refine my design.</li>
    
   <li>3. Post-submission admission: Ironically enough, I had the immense urge to eat an entire tub of ice-cream 
     as soon as I was done with the assignment AND felt like I wanted to sleep for more than hours (both huge no-nos 
  by my own game rules).</li>
