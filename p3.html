        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        The assignment asked us to reflect on the conditions under which “time” moves <b>forward</b> for our clock. 
        I chose to exist in the liminal space where it simply loops. Because when you've grown up a TV addict, all
        you do is live the same day over and over. Same patterns, different shows. 'TV TIME' is how I perceive time 
        to move when I am nose-deep in my one of my characteristic binge-watching sessions. A single minute has been 
        "mapped" to the progressions of watching a series with each episode marking a single unit of time (conceptually,
        12 standarized seconds = 1 TV Time unit). Unfortunately, I struggled with the reset button since you can't reset 
        time itself but give it a [human] minute and watch the clock give you a glimpse into A Day in My Life.

      <p>
        1. The 3 shortlisted ways of tracking time included a) train time b) TV time and c) hair-growth time
        
        <img src = "https://cdn.glitch.com/d4bc6f13-b09b-4f55-89bf-4831c101d69e%2FUntitled_Artwork%203.jpg?v=1632643757824"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          <br>
    <div>
      
      
      
      
 <p> 2. The basic pseudocode for each is as follows:
          a) Train Time: The passage of each train becomes one unit of time. 
          <p>
            
            if (train leaves the station);</p>
       <p>   {unit of time = unit of time + 1};
            </p>
        <br>  <p>
      
    This concept struggled to match the chaotic energy I'd envisioned for my personal clock.
    There was a need to include multiple playful variables. </p>
    </br>
         <p> b) TV Time: This was eventually chosen because it is a nod to my Reading Response for Week 3--
          <i>"In contrast to what may be categorized as more of a universal experience, an instance of 
          alternative time for me specifically is “TV time”."</i>
      </br>
if (s == 30 seconds)
{episode plays}
else if (s>30 seconds and less than 40 seconds)
{I'm taking a break}

  The Groundhog Day-esque treatment was of particular interest to me since it happens to be my favorite genre of cinema. </p>

<br> <p>
  
  c) Hair Growth Time: Time would move forward at the rate at which my body hair would grow. I wanted to mark how my
hair growth determines my clothing choices. 

if (no hair)
{I wear tank tops and shorts}
if (some growth)
{I wear t-shirts and skirts}
if (full growth)
{I wear full-sleeves and pants/trousers}

The concept hasn't been rejected altogether; only tabled for another day. </p> 
  
        <p>3. Emojis seemed a fitting choice to concretize the heavy internet presence that actually dictated TV time. 
          In the era before streaming platforms, this method of tracking time would perhaps have not existed.

      A revised version of this code included the minute() and hour() inherent p5.js functions, that added some more
        periodic flair to clock:
        <li>1. Modulo with minute() was used to simulate the "migraines" I often contracted when my eyes were glued to the
        TV for lengthy amounts of time. For a couple seconds in every alternate minute, there is a flash of jittery green
        meant to visualize a migraine.</li>
        <li>2. The hour() adds a creeping in sense of dread that maps duration to darkness. The more the hours spent in 
        a binge-watching hole, the darker is the background--a symbol of a darker life.</li>

      As is the case with my newfound coding abilities, there were many things I wanted to do but didn't know how to. 
      Adding a reset button, was one of many temporary shortfalls of my process. Map() remains a mystery that I hope
      to unravel after repeated viewings of the tutorial. However, this is the most pleased I have been with any of my 
      sketches so far. 3, to be precise. I mostly achieved everything I set out to but continue to refine my written
      code, which isn't as coherent as I would like it to be. 
      
      The beauty of the experimental clock was in its applied thinking. My mind was reaching for ideas it had never 
      been asked to reach for before and coming up with one's own perception of time is hardly a tedious task. 
      Observing everyone else's drastically varied perceptions was just as inspiring in our endevour to comprehend time.
